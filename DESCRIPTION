Description: Using public voterfiles, we can interpolate the precinct boundaries
    for counties that don't publish shapefiles with a nearest neighbor algorithm.
    It's a best approximation and fills in the gaps until a better effort is 
    made to digitize precinct maps. It currently only supports Ohio counties, 
    but more states are coming in the future. This package is the result of work
    at the Voting Rights Data Institute (2018).
